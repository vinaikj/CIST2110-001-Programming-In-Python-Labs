# Lab 10 will show demonstrate how Dictionary's work in Python.

# 1. Create a dictionary called my_dict with the following key value pairs:
# Key: "name", Value: "John"
# Key: "age", Value: 30
# Key: "city", Value: "Trenton"
# Key: "state", Value: "New Jersey"


# 2. Print out the dictionary.


# 3. Print out the value for the key "name".

# 4. Lookup the key associated with the value "New Jersey" and print it out.
# Hint 1: You will need to loop through the dictionary.
# Hint 2: remember you can use the .items() method to get the key and value.

# 5. Add a new key value pair to the dictionary.
# Key: "country", Value: "USA"


# 6. Print out the dictionary.

# 7. Remove the key value pair with the key "city".

# 8. Print out the dictionary.

# 9. Create a dictionary called cities with an key as the City name and values as a dictionary that contains the state, population, and country.
# use the following data:
# Trenton, New Jersey, 84,913, USA
# New York City, New York, 8,336,817, USA
# Los Angeles, California, 3,979,576, USA
# Chicago, Illinois, 2,693,976, USA
# Houston, Texas, 2,320,268, USA
# Phoenix, Arizona, 1,680,992, USA
# Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1,584,138, USA
# San Antonio, Texas, 1,547,253, USA
# San Diego, California, 1,423,851, USA

# 10. Print a table of the data using the pandas library.
# pip install pandas


# 11. Use the tabulate library to print out the table.
# pip install tabulate


# 12. Print out the population for the city of Chicago.


# 13. **Extra** An alternative to converting a dictionary into a pandas df then tabulate, you can use dictionary unpacking and tabulate.
# Dictionary unpacking is a new feature in Python 3.9 and allows you to unpack a dictionary into a list of dictionaries.
# You can then use tabulate to print out the table.

# In our case, {"City": city, **info} creates a new dictionary that includes a "City" key with the city name and all the key-value pairs from the info dictionary.

# For example, if city is "Chicago" and info is {"state": "Illinois", "Population": 2693976, "Country": "USA"}, the new dictionary will be {"City": "Chicago", "state": "Illinois", "Population": 2693976, "Country": "USA"}. This is the same as {"City": city, **info}.
# The ** operator unpacks the info dictionary into the new dictionary

# Transform the data

# Print the table using tabulate


# 14. How many cities have a population greater than 1 million? Use a for loop to iterate through the dictionary.

# 15.  How many cities are in the USA? Use .items() to get a list of tuples. Use a for loop to iterate through the list of tuples.
# Hint 1: You will need to use the second item in the tuple. The second item is a dictionary. IE. for city, info in cities.items():
