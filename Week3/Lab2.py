# 1. Create a variable called "name" and assign it the value of your name. Print the variable.

# 2. Create a variable called "age" and assign it the value of your age. Print the variable.

# 3. Create a variable called "favorite_color" and assign it the value of your favorite color. Print the variable.

# 4. Create a variable called "favorite_movie" and assign it the value of your favorite movie. Print the variable.

# 5. Use string concatenation to print the following sentence: "Hello, my name is <name>. I am <age> years old. My favorite color is <favorite_color> and my favorite movie is <favorite_movie>."
# Note: punctuation and capitalization matters. Make sure your sentence matches the one above exactly.

# 6. Create a variable called "my_age_in_dog_years" and assign it the value of your age multiplied by 7. 

# 7. Create a variable called "days_in_a_year" and assign it the value of 365.

# 8. Create a variable called "days_alive" and assign it the value of your age multiplied by the number of days in a year.

# 9. Create a variable called "days_alive_in_dog_years" and assign it the value of your age in dog years multiplied by the number of days in a year.

# 10. Create a chart that shows the following information:
# - Your name
# - Your age
# - Your favorite color
# - Your favorite movie
# - Your age in dog years
# - Number of days in a year
# - Number of days you have been alive
# - Number of days you have been alive in dog years

Make it look pretty as well as informative. Use the following format:
==================================
| Name: John Doe                 |
| Age: 25                        |
| Favorite Color: Blue           |
| Favorite Movie: The Matrix     |
| Age in Dog Years: 175          |
| Days in a Year: 365            |
| Days Alive: 9125               |
| Days Alive in Dog Years: 63875 |
==================================
Hints:
- Use the string concatenation operator (+) to combine strings and variables
- print has an optional parameter called "end" that can be used to change the default newline character (\n) to something else or maybe even add a tab (\t) to the end of the line (or multiple tabs)
- You will need to use conversion functions to convert your numbers to strings
